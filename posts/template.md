An introduction or summary paragraph.

Notice the horizontal rule? It separates the post header from the rest of the content---which is here.

To further explain this template:

1. The post title.
2. Subtitle can be added.
3. A list of meta data. Each meta data item is a key and a value, or a list value as a comma seperated list.
4. A paragraph for introduction or summary can be added.

Another horizontal rule to test any regex based on "---".
