Notice the horizontal rule? It separates the post header from the rest of the content---which is here.

To further explain this template:

1. The post title.
2. Subtitle can be added, keep it empty, or place the excerpt here.
3. A list of meta data. Each meta data item is a key and a value, or a list value as a comma seperated list.
4. The excerpt, or empty. If it's empty items 2. will be excerpt.

Another horizontal rule to test any regex based on "---".
